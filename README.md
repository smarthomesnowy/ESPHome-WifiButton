# ESPHome-WifiButton

## Idea

Create a wireless button to control Home Assistant from a big industrial control ON/OFF button.
The button will have an ESP8266 running ESPHome and will have the logic for single press, double press and long press therefore being able to do three different actions on one single button.
It will sit in my bedrrom and run autumations to turn on off all the lights and a wake up autumation.
The button will be powered with a mobile phone powerbank to make it porrtable.
Onboard there will be a PIR motion sensor that ties into the Home Assistant Alarmo home alarm system and a temprature and humidty sensor that ties into the climate control system.
